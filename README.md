# nigardsbreen_data-campaign

"Jostedalen2023_observations-and-simulations.ipynb" uses "loadData.py" and "plotData.py" to load and plot observational data from the Jostedalen 2023 field campaign organised by the interdisciplinary JOSTICE project. The produced figures are used in a manuscript that will be submitted to JGR Atmospheres.
